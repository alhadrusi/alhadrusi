## Hello! 👋

Hello! I am a student majoring electrical computer engineering with a minor in computer science at Wayne State University.
I am interested in hardware development and the interaction of software with hardware, and how engineering can help those around us.

**I'm involved in a variety of organizations and clubs, most notably the following:**
- *Robotics*
- *Tau Beta Pi*
- *IEEE*
